<!-- What is the central question or problem this project explores? -->
The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on small businesses and restaurants across the globe. The restrictions imposed by local and state governments in an effort to curb the spread of the virus forced businesses to alter their strategies. Many struggled with this change, but some were able to overcome it and remain profitable.  

<!-- Why is this topic relevant or important to understand? -->
For this project, we’ll be exploring the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on restaurants and small businesses in the cities of Tampa and Philadelphia. 

<!-- Where does the data come from? -->
We’ll be using the Yelp Open Dataset, a subset of data that Yelp has collected on over 100,000 businesses across 11 different metro areas, including millions of reviews.  

<!-- What does the dataset cover (scope, time period, granularity) and why? (show some time based plots) -->


<!-- Why These Two Cities -->
There were different approaches when COVID struck, on the one hand, we have cities that were very strict with their local regulations, like Philadelphia; on the other, there were those that were more lax, such as Tampa.

<!-- why only restaurants  impact of covid on restaurant (use external source) and show calplot -->
One of the easiest ways of visualizing the impact of it without going to the extreme cases is with hospitality businesses, more particularly, restaurants. Restaurants were affected by the lockdown conditions, but some of them were still open and changed their tactics to still provide to their clientele.
