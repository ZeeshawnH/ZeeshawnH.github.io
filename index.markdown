<!-- What is the central question or problem this project explores? -->
The COVID-19 pandemic had a profound impact on small businesses and restaurants across the globe. The restrictions imposed by local and state governments in an effort to curb the spread of the virus forced businesses to alter their strategies. Many struggled with this change, but some were able to overcome it and remain profitable.  

<!-- Why is this topic relevant or important to understand? -->
For this project, we’ll be exploring the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on restaurants and small businesses in the cities of Tampa and Philadelphia. We’ll be using the Yelp Open Dataset, a subset of data that Yelp has collected on over 100,000 businesses across 11 different metro areas, including millions of reviews.
